# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Research on apartment sales ads

### 1. Project description

I will work with Yandex.Realty's archive of property ads for St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas covering the past few years. I will learn how to determine the market value of real estate. My task is to define parameters. This will make it possible to create an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraud.

There are two different types of data available for every apartment for sale. The first type is user input. The second type was calculated automatically based upon the map data. This includes distance from the city center, the airport, and the nearest park or body of water.

### 3. Questions to be answered

Followings are the questions that need to be answered for the project evaluation:

* How do you explain the problems identified in the data?
* Which methods you used to process missing values?
* How you use data slices?
* Whether or not your graphs solve the specific type of tasks
* Which methods you used to plot graphs?
* Whether or not you export the final data into pivot tables
* Whether you did or didn't automate graph plotting
* Whether you calculate the correlation indicators in the data and how you explain them?
* Whether you follow the project structure and keep the code tidy
* The conclusions you come to
* Whether you leave comments about the steps.
